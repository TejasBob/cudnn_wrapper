# cudnn_wrapper
Python wrapper for Nvidia cuDNN library

This is a sample project to examplify how to write a wrapper for cuDNN library from Nvidia.

This idea can be extended to any library which is published / distributed as shared object library on linux.

I'll update requirements.txt for Python3 virtual environment and how to go about the wrapping.

Till then happy tinkeing!
